## Bugs

1. while writing the site i noticed an issue between clicking play game and Rules buttons where one would not replace the other instead they would stack on top of each other.

2. Video wont display on modal - This was caused by a rogue line of code in the Java Script setting the display of the video to none.

3. Modal wont close when button is clicked - This was caused by several typos when resolved the modals closed as intended.
